Post Test Suite Processing --- how to zip the Report Folder in Katalon Studio
====

This is a small [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com/katalon-studio/) project for demonstration purpose.

You can download the zip at the [releases page](https://github.com/kazurayam/Post_TestSuite_processing/releases).

This project was developed using Katalon Studio v8.1.0 but is not dependent on the KS version.
It should work on every versions of KS.

This project is meant to propose a solution to the discussion raised in Katalon Forum at

- [How to zip the Report Folder](https://forum.katalon.com/t/how-to-zip-the-report-folder/58763)

## Caution

I used Mac. This project assumes that `/bin/sh` command is available, which is usually true on Mac and Linux. You should be able to rewrite this for Windows + PowerShell environment easily.

## Demonstration

This project demonstrates how automate making a zip file of Reports generated by a Test Suite execution.

Please download this project, open it with your local Katalon Studio, run a Test Suite Collection named `TSC`. Just run it to see what `TSC` does.

1. Open a Test Suite Collection named `Test Suites/TCS`. It comprises with 2 Test Suites.
  * `Test Suites/TS1`
  * `Test Suites/TS_post_TS1_processing`
2. Click the Execute button to run it. It will run for a few seconds. ![01_TSC](docs/images/01_TSC.png)
3. The `TS1` will run for a few second and pass, but `TS_post_TS1_proocessing ` will fail. It fails intentionally for demostration purpose. Don't mind it.
4. Once `TSC` finished, a folder named `out` will be be created under the project directory. ![02_out](docs/images/02_out_folder.png)
>However, Katalon Studio has a bug; *the newly created `out` folder will not be visible in the Test Explorer pane*. So, please close the project once and reopen it in order to let Katalon Studio be acknowled of the new `out` folder. 
5. In the `out` folder, you will find two files created by the `TSC`. 
  * `out/consume_TS_report.sh`
  * `out/Reports_yyyyMMdd_hhmmss.zip`
  >Here `yyyyMMdd_hhmmss` represent a varying time stamp.
6. Please check the content of the `Reports_yyyyMMdd_hhmmss.zip` file using your favorite archiver software. In the zip file, you will find the test report in HTML/CSV/XML generated by a Test Suite named `Test Suites/TS1`. ![03_zip](docs/images/03_zip.png)
8. `TSC` calls `Test Suite/TS1`, which calls a Test Case `TC1`. `TC1` is a skeltal Test Case example, like this:
```
import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.keyword.WebUiBuiltInKeywords as WebUI

WebUI.comment("Here you can do whatever you like")
```
9. Katalon Studio will generate a set of reports of `Test Suite/TS1` into the folder `Reports/yyyyMMdd_hhmmss/TS1/yyyyMMdd_hhss2`.
10. After `TS1`, `TSC` calls one more Test Suite `TS_post_TS1_processing`. It will make a zip file in the `out` folder at `out/Reports_yyyyMMdd_hhmmss.zip`.

In short, the `TSC` demonstrates that the Test Suite `TS_post_TS1_processing` makes a zip file of the Reports generated by the Test Suite `TS1`.

## Problem to solve

Why I developed this demo project? Let me tell it you. Katalon Studio users often want to make a zip file of the Reports of a Test Suite execution. If you don't mind doing it manually after a Test Suite finished, you can:

1. In Windows Explorer GUI, open the project folder
2. Dig the folder tree to reach `<projectDir>/Reports/yyyyMMdd_hhmmss/testSuiteName/yyyyMMdd_hhmmss2` folder
3. Right-click the folder and choose "archive it" menu.
4. You are done. You will get a zip file which contains HTML/CSV/XML reports.

But I don't like to do it manually. I want to **automate zipping the Reports**. Not only creating the file, I want to do more. For example, I want to transfer the zip to some remote storage for further processing.

How can I do it in a Katalon Studio project?

## Technical difficulties

I found 3 technical issues that I had to overcome.

### Timing issue

People naively expects that HTML/XML reports of a Test Suite `TS1` to be present and accessible in the Report folder when the `@AfterTestSuite`-annotated method in a TestListener is invoked. Unfortunately the fact is not the case. When a `@AfterTestSuite`-annotated method is invoked, the HTML/XML reports are not present there yet.

I can show you a proof.

When you run the Test Suite Collection `TSC`, you should be able to find the following messages in the Console.

```
TS1ReportDirLister output ----------------------------------------------
executing: ls -la ./Reports/20211023_172734/TS1/20211023_172736
return code = 0
total 40
drwxr-xr-x  6 kazuakiurayama  staff    192 Oct 23 17:27 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 kazuakiurayama  staff     96 Oct 23 17:27 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 kazuakiurayama  staff   2649 Oct 23 17:27 execution.properties
-rw-r--r--  1 kazuakiurayama  staff  11108 Oct 23 17:27 execution0.log
-rw-r--r--  1 kazuakiurayama  staff      0 Oct 23 17:27 execution0.log.lck
-rw-r--r--  1 kazuakiurayama  staff     64 Oct 23 17:27 testCaseBinding
```

This message is emitted by [Test Listeners/TS1ReportDirLister](Test Listeners/TS1ReportDirLister.groovy). It executes a Command `ls -la ./Reports/20211023_172734/TS1/20211023_172736` in the `@AfterTestSuite`-annotated method. As you can see in the report folder, there is a bulky `execution0.log` file butno HTML/XML reports are there yet.

Katalon Studio will compile HTML/XML report after `@AfterTestSuite`-annotated method finished. Therefore the `@AfterTestSuite`-annotated method after `TS1` can not make a zip file of the reports of `TS1`.

### Variable path

In order to write a script to zip a folder, the script must know the path of target folder. On the other hand, Katalon Studio assigns the path of a report folder for `TS1` like:

- `Reports/20211023_125201/TS1/20211023_125203`

As you can see, this path has variable parts (time stamp). How can my script find the concrete value of the variable folder path?

### How to run a Command from Groovy

In order to create a zip file of a folder contents, I want to use the good old bash shell commands: `zip`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `echo` etc. Also I want to use `curl` command to transfer files over network.

I will create, by Groovy script (TestListener), a shell script file named `consume_TS_report.sh`. Then, how can I execute that shell script with `/bin/sh` (bash shell interpreter) from my Groovy script (TestCase)?

## Proposed solution

### Running Shell Script using the subprocessj library

The `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` class enables running arbitrary commands in a new process from Groovy script. The following article covers how to use it.
